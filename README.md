A theory for an idea about brain controlled VR.

1. Make a set of "instructions" and "input" with the user for it's interaction with the system.
2. The system scans the brain, and body if necessary, for "inputs" and sends "instructions" to the brain and body for calibrations.
3. After calibrations the system interacts with the user in preconstructed games, worlds or something else.
